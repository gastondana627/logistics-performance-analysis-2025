Technical Audit & Data Fidelity:
This analysis was powered by the Samsung BioActive Sensor suite on the 
Galaxy Watch 5. Data aggregation and AI-enhanced sensor fusion were 
performed via the S22 Ultra hub. This project isolates Operational Strain 
by filtering out non-sortation movement to provide an accurate representation 
of physical output during the 2025 Peak Season.
```

### Key Hardware Components Highlighted
1. **Samsung BioActive Sensor** - Primary data collection device
2. **Galaxy Watch 5** - Wearable hardware platform
3. **S22 Ultra** - Data aggregation and processing hub

## 3. Strategic Summary Updates

### Location
- Strategic Summary section (below Hero Header)

### Updated Content
```
A high-fidelity analysis of 3 compressed operational windows during the 
2025 UPS Peak Season. Powered by the Samsung BioActive Sensor suite on 
the Galaxy Watch 5, this study isolates Operational Strain by filtering 
out non-sortation movement, demonstrating the intersection of industrial 
logistics and biometric data science through precision measurement and 
engineering-grade metrics.
```

### Hardware Integration
- Samsung BioActive Sensor: `text-ups-gold font-semibold`
- Galaxy Watch 5: `text-ups-gold font-semibold`
- Emphasizes Samsung ecosystem throughout

## 4. Visual Hierarchy

### Disclaimer Prominence Levels

**High Visibility (Technical):**
- Amber warning color scheme
- Icon indicator (Code icon)
- Bold header
- Contained in bordered box

**Low Visibility (Legal):**
- Muted zinc-500 color
- Smallest font size (10px)
- Bottom placement
- Separated by subtle border

### Rationale
- Technical disclaimer: Important for data science credibility
- Legal disclaimer: Required but non-intrusive
- Both maintain dark glassmorphism aesthetic
