## Usage in Presentations

### For Recruiters
"This knowledge graph shows how I built a complete data pipeline from field sensors to academic publication, integrating public safety data with personal biometrics."

### For Academic Audiences
"The architecture demonstrates reproducible research principles: ORCID verification, public data sources (OSHA), and transparent methodology (Kaggle notebook)."

### For Technical Interviews
"I designed a layered system with clear separation of concerns: data ingestion, processing logic, validation protocols, and dual output paths (academic + public)."

## Future Expansion

Potential additions to the graph:
- Machine learning prediction layer
- Multi-facility comparison nodes
- Longitudinal analysis pipeline
- Additional wearable integrations
- Policy recommendation engine
